Operations Under Pressure
One-day full-stack engineering assessment
At Newtonite, engineers are expected to do more than implement specifications. We 
expect you to understand a problem, make reasonable assumptions, identify risks, 
design a coherent solution, and take ownership of the resulting system.
This exercise intentionally leaves several decisions unspecified. That is part of the assessment.

The Situation
A rapidly growing company currently coordinates operational work through a mixture of chat 
messages, spreadsheets, email, and direct conversations. This worked when the company had a 
small team. It no longer works with several hundred employees.
Every day, teams receive requests that require investigation or action. A request might be a 
customer issue, an engineering problem, a payment requiring investigation, a production incident, a 
compliance request, or an operational task requiring approval.
These requests often involve several people. Some are urgent. Some require approval before they 
can move forward. Some change ownership several times. Sometimes two people begin working on 
the same issue without realizing it. Sometimes one person changes a request while another person is 
still viewing or editing an older version.
Important requests occasionally disappear inside long message threads. Management has no 
reliable way to understand what work is happening, who owns it, what requires immediate 
attention, what changed, whether something has been forgotten, or why a particular decision was 
made.
The company wants to replace this workflow with an internal web application. You have been asked 
to design and build the first usable version.
Your Goal
Build a system that allows teams to coordinate and manage operational work reliably.
We intentionally have not specified exactly what the application should look like or how every 
workflow should behave. Part of this challenge is determining what a good solution should be. Make 
reasonable product and engineering decisions based on the situation above, and document 
important assumptions where appropriate.
What the System Should Enable
At a minimum, users should be able to create and manage operational work items. A work item 
should be capable of representing something that requires investigation, action, or resolution.
A user should be able to understand:
 what the item is and why it exists;
 its current state and importance;
 who is responsible for it;
 what has happened previously;
 what requires attention next.
Different users may interact with the same work item at approximately the same time. Your system 
should behave sensibly in these situations.

Teams, Identity, and Access
The company contains multiple teams. A user may belong to one or more teams and may have 
different responsibilities within them. Not every user should be able to perform every action.
Your solution should contain a meaningful authorization model. Authorization must be enforced by 
the system itself and should not rely only on hiding controls in the user interface. You may decide 
what roles or permission model make sense for your solution.
Collaboration and History
Users need to collaborate around work items and understand how an item has evolved over time. If 
responsibility changes, priority changes, or the item progresses through a workflow, other users 
should be able to understand what happened. Important actions should not silently disappear.
Concurrent Usage
Assume the application is being used by many employees simultaneously. Consider situations such 
as:
 two users attempting to take responsibility for the same work;
 one user viewing information that another user has just changed;
 multiple updates reaching the system within a short period;
 a user repeating an action because they are unsure whether the first request succeeded.
Your implementation should handle at least some of these situations deliberately rather than relying 
entirely on ideal user behavior.
User Experience
The application should provide a useful overview of ongoing work. A user should be able to quickly 
determine what requires attention and locate relevant work without manually browsing through 
everything in the system.
The application should remain usable as the amount of stored work grows. We care significantly 
more about a coherent and responsive experience than decorative UI.
System Behaviour
Some operations do not necessarily need to happen synchronously. Actions such as notifications, 
processing, enrichment, or other secondary work may happen after the primary action has 
completed.
You may introduce asynchronous processing if you believe it improves your architecture. If you do 
so, consider what happens when processing fails, executes more than once, or is delayed.

Expected Scale
You do not need to build infrastructure for millions of users. However, design the application as if 
the company expects continued growth. Assume approximately:
 thousands of registered users;
 hundreds to a few thousand simultaneous users;
 many teams;
 tens of thousands of active work items;
 a large and continually growing history of previous activity.
Your solution should not depend on loading the entire dataset into the browser or processing 
everything in application memory.
Engineering Expectations
We are not prescribing your technology choices. Choose technologies that allow you to deliver a 
reliable solution within the available time. We are interested in the reasoning behind those 
decisions.
Your submission should demonstrate meaningful consideration of:
 data modelling;
 API design;
 frontend state management;
 authorization;
 concurrent operations;
 error handling;
 data consistency;
 search and filtering;
 application performance;
 maintainability.
You are not expected to solve every possible distributed-systems problem. We would rather see a 
smaller system with well-considered behaviour than a large system containing many incomplete 
features.
Critical Behaviour
Your solution must demonstrate at least three situations where correctness requires more than 
simple CRUD operations.
Examples may include, but are not limited to:
 simultaneous actions by multiple users;
 preventing accidental duplicate operations;
 handling stale information;
 enforcing workflow rules;
 performing reliable asynchronous processing;
 handling authorization at the resource level;

 reconciling optimistic frontend state with server decisions.
You may choose which problems are most important for your design. Be prepared to explain them.
Engineering Decisions
Include a short document named ENGINEERING_DECISIONS.md (or equivalent) explaining 
approximately five important decisions you made while building the application.
These may include why you structured the data in a certain way, how you handle concurrent 
updates, what you chose to make synchronous versus asynchronous, how authorization works, or 
what you intentionally chose not to build.
We are interested in trade-offs. There is rarely one correct architectural answer.
Testing
You are not expected to achieve an arbitrary test-coverage percentage. Instead, identify behaviours 
that would be particularly dangerous if they were incorrect and write automated tests covering at 
least some of those behaviours. Your testing strategy should reflect the risks in your own 
architecture.
AI and Coding Tools
You may use coding assistants, AI agents, documentation, search engines, and other development 
tools. There is no penalty for doing so.
You are responsible for every architectural decision and every behaviour contained in your 
submission. During the review, you may be asked to explain or modify any part of your 
system.
Submission
Your submission should contain:
 working source code;
 clear instructions for running the application;
 any required setup instructions;
 your engineering decisions document;
 automated tests for important behaviour;
 a brief description of known limitations.
Architecture diagrams or additional documentation are welcome if they help explain your solution.
Time
You will have one working day to build your solution. Prioritize carefully.
We do not expect a production-complete enterprise platform. We expect a thoughtful 
engineering solution that demonstrates what you consider important when building reliable 
software.

Final Discussion
At the end of the exercise, you will demonstrate your application and discuss your implementation. 
Be prepared to explain:
 how your architecture works;
 what happens when things fail;
 what assumptions you made;
 which parts of the system you consider most important;
 what you would change if the application grew significantly;
 what you would work on next if you had another week.
The quality of your engineering reasoning is as important as the number of features 
completed.
